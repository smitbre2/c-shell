Hey there. Let me introduce you to how to navigate this jank software.

	1.) First you will want to compile the single smallsh.c file with gcc
	   a) For a process very much like the assignments example...
	   	gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c

	2.) After using the above compilation command, the shell can be run through smallsh



If you find yourself:
	1. Without a : line prompt,
	   	You can simply call cd or status to realign.
		Even if there is no prompt visible. The shell will still function as normally.
